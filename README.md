# FortiGate-Security-Lab-with-Active-Directory
A hands-on lab simulating an enterprise network environment with FortiGate firewall. Includes Web Filtering, Application Control, and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). Demonstrates ability to secure client traffic and monitor network activity.

## Project Overview
This project is a hands-on lab built in Hyper-V with **firewall, routing, and security concepts** using a FortiGate virtual appliance.  
It simulates a small enterprise environment with:
- **FortiGate Firewall** (LAN/WAN separation, NAT, policies)
- **Windows Server (Domain Controller + DHCP/DNS)**
- **Windows 10 Client** (test machine)

## Lab Environment
- FortiGate VM
- Windows Server 2019 (AD/DHCP/DNS)
- Windows 10 Test Client VM
- Hypervisor: Hyper-V

---
## üîß Setup Steps
1. Imported FortiGate `.vhd` into Hyper-V  
2. Configured **two network adapters** (External = WAN, Internal = LAN)  
3. Assigned LAN IP = `192.168.1.160`, WAN = external DHCP/Static  
4. Disabled DHCP on FortiGate, kept DC as DHCP server  
5. Added firewall policy (LAN ‚Üí WAN, NAT enabled)  
6. Verified Internet access from test VM through FortiGate

## üîê Features Tested
- ‚úÖ Basic Routing & NAT  
- ‚úÖ AD Integration (DHCP, DNS)  
- ‚úÖ Firewall Policies  
- ‚úÖ Web GUI access via `https://192.168.1.160

## Routing Interface
- **WAN (port1)** ‚Üí External switch (Internet access)
- **LAN (port2)** ‚Üí Internal switch (AD + clients)
- **Domain Controller** ‚Üí Provides DHCP & DNS
- **Clients** ‚Üí Get IP from DC, gateway = FortiGate

## Fortigate Firewall Policy Control

- **Web Filtering:** Blocking websites by category or custom URLs.
- **Application Control:** Controlling/blocking apps like P2P, Instant Messaging, and games.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Detecting/blocking malicious traffic.

## Step 1 ‚Äì Web Filtering

## Step 3 ‚Äì Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

---

## Step 4 ‚Äì Verification
- Confirm LAN ‚Üí WAN policy has Security Profiles enabled.
- Test browsing, applications, and IPS triggers from the client machine.
- Include screenshots of blocked sites, blocked apps, and IPS logs.

---

## Notes
- SSL inspection requires FortiGate CA certificate installed on client machines for HTTPS filtering.
- Deep Inspection may block legitimate traffic if clients don‚Äôt trust the certificate.
